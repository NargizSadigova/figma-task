                        Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels. But you learn to read books in
                        school, but you don't learn to watch movies. And without preparation, it can be difficult to
                        enjoy watching a movie.

                        In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious viewers. We will get acquainted with
                        the stages of film production and learn how to watch a movie through the eyes of a screenwriter,
                        director and editor. We will understand genres and look at the most important films, from
                        Citizen Kane to The Matrix.
